# Download database

Execute the following command to download a database:

```bash
db-manager download
```

You can also include additional parameters for customization:

* To set the UUID of the database, use the `--db` parameter.
* To set the UUID of the dump, use the `--dump-id` parameter. These IDs can be retrieved from the service.

If no arguments are passed, you can select the database and dump interactively.
