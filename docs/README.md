# DB Visor

## Overview

Welcome to DB Visor user documentation. There are two main sections:

1. User Guide - user documentation on how to work with a solution, step-by-step instructions on installation and configuration of the application. It should be the first step when starting to work with a solution.
2. The Development Guide contains some development notes. It could be useful for those who are going to contribute or customize.<br>

## Disclaimer

This project was started as a "pet-project," and was primarily intended to be a commercial service. However, since it has been abandoned, we decided to move it to Open Source and migrate the documentation and related assets from our internal repositories.

The reason for creating a separate "Service" interface was the project's commercial nature from the outset.&#x20;

Let us know by email at support@dbvisor.pro if you notice any issues in the documentation, or fix them directly and contribute.
